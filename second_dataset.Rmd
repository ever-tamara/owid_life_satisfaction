## 🔢 Table

```{r}
cantril %>% 
  filter(Year %in% c(1993, 2022)) %>% 
  pivot_wider(names_from = Year, values_from = `Happiness: Happy (aggregate)`, id_cols = Country) %>% 
  select(Country, `1993`, `2022`) %>% 
  mutate(`Absolute change` = round(`2022` - `1993`, 3)) %>% 
  mutate(`Relative change` = (`2022` - `1993`) / `1993`) %>% 
  reactable(
    columns = list(`Relative change` = colDef(format = colFormat(percent = TRUE, digits = 1))) 
  )
```

## 🌎 Map

```{r}
cantril %>% 
  mutate(`Happiness: Happy (aggregate)` = round(`Happiness: Happy (aggregate)`, 2)) %>%
  plot_geo(width = 940) %>% 
  add_trace(
    z = ~`Happiness: Happy (aggregate)`,
    color = ~`Happiness: Happy (aggregate)`,
    locations = ~Code,
    text = ~Country,
    frame = ~Year, colors = "BuPu"
  ) %>% 
  colorbar(title = NULL)
```

## 📈 Chart

```{r}
# simple line chart of the data, for five countries on different continents (ggplot, piped into ggplotly)

cantril_chart_happiness <- 
  cantril %>% 
  filter(Country %in% c("Norway", "Australia", "Germany", "Bolivia", "Colombia", "Peru", "Philippines")) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = Year, y = `Happiness: Happy (aggregate)`, color = Country)) +
  geom_line() +
  scale_y_continuous(limits = c(0, 100)) +
  labs(x = NULL,
       y = NULL, 
       color = NULL) +
  theme_minimal() 

ggplotly(cantril_chart_happiness, width = 940)
```

## Advanced (Optional) 📈

The following chart demonstrates that it is possible to approximate the functionality of our World in Data grapher for multicountry selection using R, specifically with the `crosstalk` package and a small amount of custom JavaScript. For more information on how to achieve this, see [this Stack Overflow question](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/67058016/how-to-set-default-values-in-filter-select-in-crosstalk-in-r-plotly).

Note that this is not a required task, but rather a showcase of what can be achieved. The code for this will be shared when we provide the solutions for the exercise.

```{r}
pacman::p_load(crosstalk)


# Crosstalk shared data
shared_cantril_happiness <- highlight_key(cantril)

cantril_plotly <- plot_ly(
  shared_cantril_happiness, 
  x = ~Year, 
  y = ~`Happiness: Happy (aggregate)`, 
  color = ~Country, 
  type = "scatter", 
  mode = "lines+markers"
) %>%
  layout(yaxis = list(range = c(0, 100)))


country_filter <- filter_select(
  "country_filter", 
  "Select a country to examine", 
  shared_cantril_happiness, 
  ~Country, 
  multiple = TRUE
)

bscols(
  list(country_filter, cantril_plotly)
)
```

```{=html}
<script>
function filter_default() {
  var default_countries = ["Norway", "Australia", "Germany", "Bolivia", "Colombia", "Bhutan"]; // Set default countries here
  document.getElementById("country_filter").getElementsByClassName("selectized")[0].selectize.setValue(default_countries, false);
}
window.onload = filter_default;
</script>
```
